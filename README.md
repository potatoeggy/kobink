# Kobink

Automatically sync local books to your Kobo by pretending to be the Kobo Store

### Setup

On the Kobo, open `/.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf` and change `api_endpoint` to your local machine where Kobink runs (e.g., `http://192.168.0.1:3000`). By default, Kobink runs on port 3000.

Install dependencies and run:

```
LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/epubs cargo run
```

Press "Sync" on the Kobo â€” all EPUB files in `LIBRARY_PATH` should now automatically be fetched to the device.
